# RoleSwitch - Obsidian Plugin

An Obsidian plugin that helps you consciously switch between different work roles‚Äîlike developer, writer, researcher, or QA‚Äîwith intentional transitions and session tracking.

> **Why I built this**: I wear many hats throughout the day (developer, writer, researcher). This plugin helps me be intentional about which role I'm in and switch between them mindfully.
